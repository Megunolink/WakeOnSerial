WakeOnSerial
============
Sample to demonstrate waking an Arduino microcontroller using messages from the serial port. 

The LowPower library (https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power) is used to put the microcontroller to sleep. 

The PinChangeInt library (https://code.google.com/p/arduino-pinchangeint/) is used to wake the device. 

Both libraries are included in the project files & should be moved into your Arduino libraries folder. 

The MegunoLink Pro project provides a button to wake and sleep the micro. More information is available at: http://www.MegunoLink.com/
